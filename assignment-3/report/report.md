# Reflection on my Intended Design

There are neither any classes missing nor any extra classes in my design, but some improper classes names. Classes should not be named as plural format as “Die” presented in my design, which should be “Dice”, “User Interface” in my design is less preferred than “Console UI” as the latter specifically states what kind of User Interface is, “Human Player” is more proper than “Human” in my design as it states specifically that it is a player role in the game.  

Connection annotation has been used correctly such as Association and dependency not id-conncection, but there are much differences of relations between classes, a lack of some relations between classes in my design is of it. First of all, “Tile” should be point to itself as it should be linked to previous and next one. Secondly, There should be a association relationship between “Player” and “Property” as “Property” may belong to a “Player”, “Player” is an attribute of “Property” as it is the owner of it. Also, there should be a dependency relationship between “Console UI” and “Player”, because “ConsoleUI” use “Player”, which are the parameters of some methods in “Console UI”.  There should be a realization relationship between “Human Player” and “Player” as the “Human Player” implements Interface “Player”. There should be dependency relation not association relation between “Player” and “Dice” as “Dice” is used by “Player” not the field of “Player”. A dependency relationship should be there between “Console UI” and “Tile” as “Tile” is used as parameter of a method of “Console UI”, there should be an association relationship between “Human Player” and “Tile” as “Tile” is an attribute of “Human player” showing what tile the player currently stopped on. Regarding of the behaviours, although they are divided into different classes not in one central class in my class diagram, there is a lack of behaviours of classes comparing to the standard one. 

There are also differences for object diagrams. Tiles are in a cycled linked list, one tile is connected to the next one and previous one, so relations of the both should be marked between two tiles with two connection lines. There is also a repeated object “:Human” in the diagram, as there is already a player named Boris in it. There are much differences for suquence diagram, as mentioned before, “Human” is repeated as there is already a Boris player in it. The messages between two objects should be explicitly expressed, such as what behaviours of objects have been executed and what results have been returned. Also, self messages which stand for behaviours of objects themselves should also be explicitly presented. The lifeline execution bar should also be set correctly, or it may cause confuse[1].

This is my initial UML design, which there is much to improve. In the class diagram, there are some relations between classes should be considered. Also, a lack of behaviours of some objects, causing problems in sequence diagram, which is the most problematic one of all three diagrams. The most important lesson I learned from this design is the relations between classes should be fully considered and also do their behaviours. Only the whole picture be established first, the classes would be set properly, and only the rules and procedures of the game be fully understand, the relations between classes and behaviours of objects would not be omitted.
